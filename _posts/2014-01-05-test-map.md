Testing out adding the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) quick start map to the new Jekyll-powered blog. This is pretty sweet. I\'m not entirely sure why yet, but to get the map to play nice with Bootstrap, I had to put a space in the map div. This may not have been necessary now that there is text here in the blog entry, but if it just the map is on the page, it\'s necessary. This example differs from the Leaflet quick start only in that it uses OpenStreetMap tiles directly rather than through Cloudmade.

<div id="map"> </div>
